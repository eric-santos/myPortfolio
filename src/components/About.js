        I am interested in Software Engineering and seeking exciting opportunities in Full-Stack or
        Front-End Development. I am currently enrolled as a Full-Stack Developer in Lambda School
        (Remote) scheduled to become endorsed by January 2021. Being a first generation American,
        and Army Veteran. I have repeatedly been exposed to new cultures and diverse groups of
        people.

        <br />
        This has made me quick to adapt to changes and gain a broader perspective. I am always
        curious about things and enjoy learning. I like to solve problems, fix errors ,and I am
        detail oriented. I keep my goals and tasks organized to maintain productivity.
        <br />
        <br />I have had the opportunity to become a Diesel Mechanic with United Rentals working in
        Houston, TX and got promoted to the front office as an Inside Sales in the Trenching
        department in El Paso, TX. I believe that the skills that I have attained from the dynamic
        environment and competitive boot camp life define me and I look forward to implementing and
        polishing these skills.
